    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    I'm a 19 y/o sound design enthuasist, music maker, hobby-recordist and programmer!<br>

    I love collecting impulse responses as a hobby and I've built lost of weird ass impulse sources! <br>
    Currently my favourite impulse source is a chain whip I made for this purpose  (scary, i know...) <br>
    I have also tried standard methods too. Balloon, clap, wooden clapper and sine sweeps (more about that later XD)<br>
    <p>
    Currently, I'm making a wasm app for recording and deconvolving impulse responses on your phone! Well, I haven't started yet but I'll put a link once it's in a usable state :D <br>
    </p>

    I'm currently studying... Chimney sweeping! Lmao. <br>
    Here's some cool stuff I'm building for this website:
